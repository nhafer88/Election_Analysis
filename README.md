# Colorado Election Audit

## Project Overview
This project completed an audit of recent local congressional election tasked by the Colorado Board of Elections. The areas of focus for the audit include the following:

1. Calculating the total number of votes cast
2. Calculating the the number of votes and percentage of the total votes votes each county in the precinct received.
3. Determing the county with the largest number of votes
4. Getting a complete list of candidates who received votes
5. Calculating the number of votes and the perecentage of the total votes for each candidate received total number of votes each candidate received
6. Determining the winning candidate of election based on popular vote

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Recommendations for Further Analyses
  - Modifications in the coding script could be used for determining percentage of total votes and number of votes for each voting party as well as identify prevalence of each party among the counties. 
  - Furthemore, the coding script could be used for determining percentage of total votes and number votes for propostions that are on a ballot.
